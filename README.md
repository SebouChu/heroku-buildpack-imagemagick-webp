imagemagick-from-source-buildpack
===========================

Use [ImageMagick](www.imagemagick.org) from source inside a Heroku/Scalingo environment. This buildpack will download the library, build it from source and install it along side your app. Your ```$PATH``` and ```$LD_LIBRARY_PATH``` will also be updated to use this version of ImageMagick instead of the default Heroku/Scalingo one, which may _not_ have support of some formats (like WebP).

Since this buildpack is building ImageMagick from source your first deploy will take a very long time (around 10 mins). However after building once the installed library is stored in a cache directory and will be used for all future deploys. If for any reason you want to force a rebuild of ImageMagick, please check out:
- For Heroku, the [heroku-repo](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo) plugin.
- For Scalingo, [clear the deployment cache](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/deployment/cache) with the CLI tool.

## Usage

### Heroku

```
heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/SebouChu/imagemagick-from-source-buildpack.git
```

### Scalingo

Create a `.buildpacks` file inside your app and add the buildpack like this:
```bash
https://github.com/SebouChu/imagemagick-from-source-buildpack.git
# Other buildpacks...
https://github.com/Scalingo/ruby-buildpack
```

The last line is for a Ruby application, but it can be any other buildpack you want. If it is not working with yours, please report a bug.

**NOTE**: The ImageMagick binary included in the `scalingo-18` stack does not support WebP natively. Here is what to do:

Add the [APT buildpack](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/deployment/buildpacks/apt) before this buildpack in the `.buildpacks` file.
```bash
https://github.com/Scalingo/apt-buildpack.git
https://github.com/SebouChu/imagemagick-from-source-buildpack.git
# ...
```

Create an `Aptfile` file inside your app and add the WebP library:
```
libwebp-dev
```

## Verify Installation

You can verify that ImageMagick was built correctly by running the following command:
- Heroku : `heroku run convert --version`
- Scalingo : `scalingo run convert --version`

If the output matches the version specified in `bin/compile`, you're all set.

To verify the WebP support, run the following command:
- Heroku : `heroku run identify -list format`
- Scalingo : `scalingo run identify -list format`

If the output includes `WEBP`, you're all set.
